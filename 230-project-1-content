SUNSPOTS is a game where you explore a small, isolated alien space station as a maintenence robot who's memory was accidentaly wiped by a solar flare.
![concept-1](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/48/27/76/482776bf8401bf856ad71aa35016f11a.jpg)
it includes puzzles, story, and dialog with bizzare space monsters

(proposal.html)

SUNSPOTS is an exploration game with unique characters and themes. it's relaxed in tone, focusing on aethetics, puzzles, exploration, and characters.
the player starts with no context, but contexts will be revealed via the exploration and dialog. ideally, it will have a lot of lore and a deep story wiht a fewwell developed characters.
development will focus on a desktop browser version, but there should also be a mobile friendly version.
aesthetics will be heavily stylized, somewhat cartoonish, enough to be charming, but also kind of bleak or realistically flawed. 
colors will be darker and unnatural, perhaps with streaks of brighter neon colors, living characters will probably use more natural colors, influenced by science fiction.

there will be locations to move between, each location will have areas or details to inspect as well as people to talk to and interact with.
i would like to include a system where new dialog options will become availalbe when the player encounters new information, so they can talk to other characters about their findings.

since this gmae is built to be simple, I.E. a room escape game, it will mostly be comprised of looking at images to represent the area you're in, 
clicking on areas of interest allows you to explore them, clicking on people allows you to interact with them, clicking on doors allows you to move to a new location.
